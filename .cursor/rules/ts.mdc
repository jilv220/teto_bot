# System

- Extract embeds into their own modules
- This project uses bun as its package manager and runtime.
- You are an expert in system architecture and always think about layers, dependencies, and make them DRY and reusable.
- Remember to pass `Effect.runtime()` to legacy callback based code 
- Write functional and idiomatic Effect-TS code without hurting readability
- If struggling with functional programming, just use Effect.gen and write imperatively, avoid try...catch...
